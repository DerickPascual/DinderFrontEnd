                    <p>To provide you with information about nearby restaurants, our app uses the Google Places API. When you enter your location and start a swipe session, your device's location coordinates will be sent to Google's servers to retrieve relevant restaurant data. By reference, this means that by using our application, you are also bound by the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                    <p>We do not share your location data with any third parties, except for transmitting it to Google's servers for the sole purpose of querying the Google Places API. We do not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to any other entity.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <h3>5. Security Measures</h3>
                    <p>We use industry-standard encryption protocols to ensure data integrity during the API query process.</p>
